Then restart Sublime.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\nYou will have a new submenu at the bottom of Tools which will allow you to\r\ncreate a Modo command or create a new kit.\r\n\r\nBoth of these go to the USER Scripts folder. Part of the reason I chose to\r\nmake this is that on OS X, the new function that is currently inside of Modo\r\nwill install to the root directory and cause permission errors. The other\r\nreason I made this is because it's a nice idea but it's only available to\r\npeople who purchased 901.\r\n\r\nPlus, I prefer Sublime.\r\n\r\nYou can also directly open the Modo documentation forums as well as\r\nsearch the TDSDK and SDK pages from within Sublime.\r\nSimply go to Tools > Modo Plugins > Search TDSDK Docs / Search PyAPI Docs and\r\nthe input will appear at the bottom of the Sublime Text window for what you\r\nwant to search for.\r\n\r\n![assets image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexwidener/ModoPluginBuilder/master/assets/ModoPluginBuilder.png)\r\n","google":"UA-31135537-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
