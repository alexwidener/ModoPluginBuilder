Sublime Text Plugin for generating Modo Commands inside of Sublime.

Installation:

Install through Package Control by searching for "Modo Plugin Builder"
Or download the ZIP and go to Preferences > Browse Packages and put the
ModoPluginBuilder folder in there. Then restart Sublime.

Usage:

You will have a new submenu at the bottom of Tools which will allow you to
create a Modo command or create a new kit.

Both of these go to the USER Scripts folder. Part of the reason I chose to
make this is that on OS X, the new function that is currently inside of Modo
will install to the root directory and cause permission errors. The other
reason I made this is because it's a nice idea but it's only available to
people who purchased 901.

Plus, I prefer Sublime.

You can also directly open the Modo documentation forums as well as
search the TDSDK and SDK pages from within Sublime.
Simply go to Tools > Modo Plugins > Search TDSDK Docs / Search PyAPI Docs and
the input will appear at the bottom of the Sublime Text window for what you
want to search for.
